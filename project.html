<p>Smart technologies are increasingly being utilized in all areas to improve our life. Smart Entry Management is Solution to one of the most challenging and long standing  problem in organizations. In an organizations checking plays a vital role. Attendance in many organizations like college, and schools are highly needed. Using some technologies, we are in idea to sort out this issue in college. Some of the technologies have been implemented to solve this issue. But RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) is the best alternate solution to resolve this issue. Here the radio waves are used to identify and track an object or individual. The communication concerning RFID is wireless using an electromagnetic and electrostatic coupling, where a radio frequency of spectrum is used to communicate. The system is built using the RC522 RFID model.</p>

<p>Our work comprises two most popular trends in technology research; IoT and ESP 32 module, RFID. An efficient students and staffs entry check system needs to be enforced at such places. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) based an entry system provides us with a solution that all students and staffs should not exceed the fixed time and they must wear ID card. This project describes the design of an RFID-based entry monitoring system that uniquely identifies each student and staff based on their RFID tag which is attached to their ID card. They just needs to come to entrance where we placed a Visual sensor and their details will be recorded for the day, Then this Visual sensor which are purely meant for face recognition so it detects the person coming in front of it  and their presence is detected.</p>

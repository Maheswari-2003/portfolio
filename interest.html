                How do you define photography? The word Photography literally means 'drawing with light', which derives from the Greek photo, meaning light and graph, meaning to draw. Photography is the process of recording an image – a photograph – on light-sensitive film or, in the case of digital photography, via a digital electronic or magnetic memory.

                Photography is not just about capturing images; it's about capturing moments, emotions, and stories. It allows us to freeze a moment in time and preserve it forever. Through photography, we can express our creativity, share our perspective, and connect with others on a deeper level.

                Whether you're a professional photographer or just someone who loves taking snapshots with your smartphone, photography has the power to inspire, evoke emotions, and change perceptions. It's a universal language that transcends barriers and brings people together.
